Facetorch is a Python library that can detect faces and analyze facial features using deep neural networks. The goal is to gather open-sourced face analysis models from the community, optimize them for performance using TorchScript and combine them to create a face analysis tool that one can:

1. configure using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) (OmegaConf)
2. reproduce with [conda-lock](https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
3. accelerate on CPU and GPU with [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html)
4. extend by uploading a model file to Google Drive and adding a config YAML file to the repository

Please, use the library responsibly with caution and follow the 
[ethics guidelines for Trustworthy AI from European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation.1.html). 
The models are not perfect and may be biased.
